## SkanerTicket

Prototype project!

This is a full ticketing system that includes a purchase page, a dashboard to manage tickets, and a mobile app for QR scanning.

In theory, I should be able to create a dashboard where I can manage tickets and validate them using the QR Scanner App. All of this will be connected to a website where users can actually purchase tickets.

Later, maybe do some API to connect system to other pages?

Also, Iâ€™m trying to learn Vue and Turborepo through this project. xD

### Tech

- dashboard: Vue.js
- skanerQR: ?? - solid.js?
- page: ?? - Astro.js?
- monorepo: turborepo

will see when time comes;d
